-- | Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance. Each time you transition an instance
-- from stopped to started, Amazon EC2 charges a full instance hour, even if
-- transitions happen multiple times within a single hour.
--
-- You can't start or stop Spot Instances.
--
-- Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly
-- stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are
-- released and you are not billed for hourly instance usage. However, your root
-- partition Amazon EBS volume remains, continues to persist your data, and you
-- are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any
-- time.
--
-- Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be
-- restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.
--
-- Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its
-- root device returns an error.
--
-- You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only
-- terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance
-- differs if you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an
-- instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance
-- persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other
-- devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For
-- more information about the differences between stopping and terminating
-- instances, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html Instance Lifecycle> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud UserGuide/.
