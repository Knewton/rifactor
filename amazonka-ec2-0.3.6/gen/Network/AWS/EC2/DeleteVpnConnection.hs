-- | Deletes the specified VPN connection.
--
-- If you're deleting the VPC and its associated components, we recommend that
-- you detach the virtual private gateway from the VPC and delete the VPC before
-- deleting the VPN connection. If you believe that the tunnel credentials for
-- your VPN connection have been compromised, you can delete the VPN connection
-- and create a new one that has new keys, without needing to delete the VPC or
-- virtual private gateway. If you create a new VPN connection, you must
-- reconfigure the customer gateway using the new configuration information
-- returned with the new VPN connection ID.
