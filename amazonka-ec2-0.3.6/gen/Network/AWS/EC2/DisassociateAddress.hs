-- | Disassociates an Elastic IP address from the instance or network interface
-- it's associated with.
--
-- An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or in a
-- VPC. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html Elastic IP Addresses> in the /Amazon ElasticCompute Cloud User Guide/.
--
-- This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than
-- once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error.
