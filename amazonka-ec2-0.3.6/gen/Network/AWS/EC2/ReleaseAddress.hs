-- | Releases the specified Elastic IP address.
--
-- After releasing an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool
-- and might be unavailable to you. Be sure to update your DNS records and any
-- servers or devices that communicate with the address. If you attempt to
-- release an Elastic IP address that you already released, you'll get an 'AuthFailure' error if the address is already allocated to another AWS account.
--
-- [EC2-Classic, default VPC] Releasing an Elastic IP address automatically
-- disassociates it from any instance that it's associated with. To disassociate
-- an Elastic IP address without releasing it, use 'DisassociateAddress'.
--
-- [Nondefault VPC] You must use 'DisassociateAddress' to disassociate the
-- Elastic IP address before you try to release it. Otherwise, Amazon EC2
-- returns an error ('InvalidIPAddress.InUse').
