## Description

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides
resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale
computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface
allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It
provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you
run on Amazon’s proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time
required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to
quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements
change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay
only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the
tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from
common failure scenarios.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ec2)
